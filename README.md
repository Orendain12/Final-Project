#### Topic Selected:
  
---
  Death Rates for the top 10 causes of death
  
---
#### Rationale for Topic Selection: 
  
---
As society changes, so to does the way we live. In some cases, these changes provide a better quality of life, and in other cases these changes increase longevity. Whether it is living longer or living better, death - it's frequency and causes - can tell us much about life.

---
#### Source Data: 
  
---
  This data was compiled from death certificates in all 50 states and Washington, DC. [Leading Causes of Death in the United States](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattop/leading-causes-of-death-in-the-united-states) includes total deaths and age-adjusted death rates (rate per 100,000 people) by state for ten common causes of death from 1999 to 2017. 

---
#### Questions to Answer:

---
- Which causes of death are increasing over time?
- Which causes of death are decreasing over time?
- Do changes in society correlate to increases or decreases in the death rate of related causes of death?
- Do advances in medicine and technology correlate to changes in the death rate of related causes of death?

---
#### Conclusion

---
Although the model had insufficient data to predict death rates by cause and by state as originally planned, both the model and unmodeled data shows trends toward a decrease in overall death rates in the US from 1999 to 2017. Additional data (from prior to 1999) would have likely enhanced the predictive capability of the model, and allowed the desired granularity.

#### Observations

Observations and data visualizations were made via Tableau. Still images from these visuals and dashboards can be found below, along with links to the interactable dashboard. The dashboards createed were made to be filterable by year or cause of death for easier visualization of the data. There was a focus on death rates as it reduces the data being skewed by states with larger populations; however, the visuals still included data regarding number of deaths and state populations. Further visualizations also narrowed in on which states have passed smoking bans, how these bans have impacted death rates, and how specific states have experienced changes in their death rates since the passing of the ban.
